A python tool to try different ciphers and also has a password strength checker.

Password strength checker: has entropy calculation for a simple outcome of strength.

Different Ciphers, initially tried with MD5 with hashlib and need to use cryptography module for public and private keys.

This is a playground for hash and cryptography fun. Useful when training for ethical hacking online platforms. something offline than online and good for cross referencing.
